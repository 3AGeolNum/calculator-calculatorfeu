# Calculator

# Learn & practise
 - Code in C++
 - Use the right tool and ease your life
 - Collaborate as a team
 - Present your team work

# Game rule:
## C++
 - All in english: names (variables, functions...), documentation, etc.
 - DO NOT use the standard library (std). you can use std::string and #include <iostream> but you must code your own container and dynamic_array.
 - You MUST use #include <assert.h>.
 - No graphic interface is required.
 - Your code must be tested as much as possible. Use the TEST DRIVEN APPROACH.

## Version Control System
 - use Git
 - remote on GitHub (from this repository :) )
 - Follow a clear collaborative workflow (ex: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
 - Divide developement steps in small pieces and provide explicit commits messages.

## Plateform
 - The code must work under both Linux and Windows.

## Documentation
 - Use Doxygen

## Build system
 - Use CMake

## Project management
 - Name a team leader.
 - Think about software architectur (libraries, files, class, function, ...)
 - Write tests
 - Make your tests succeed.
 - Quantify the time for each task and propose a calendar.

# Advises :
 * Clearly define the architecture. 
 * Each class and function must have one and only one purpose that can be tested. 
 * The purpose of a class/function need to be explicit in the name of a function. 
 * Name are important think about them as a team. One explicit name is the documentation (if the funtion has one and only one purpose).
 * Create one branch per task and merge regularly on the master branch.
 * Create the skeleton of the project as soon as possible and make it compile under both linux and window.
 * Please TALK and MEET! Be agile.
